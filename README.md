# Expense Tracker Dashboard

An elegant and simple expense tracker application built for personal use. This tool helps you log your daily expenses, visualize spending habits, and manage your budget with ease, all within your web browser. This project serves as a personal learning journey, and I'll be adding more features over time.



## ‚ú® Features

* **Add & Edit Expenses:** Easily add new expenses with details like title, amount, category, and date. You can also edit existing entries.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** View key insights at a glance, including monthly totals, daily averages, and top spending categories.
* **Data Visualization:** Understand your spending with a breakdown by category (pie chart) and monthly trends over time (bar chart).
* **Filtering & Search:** Find specific expenses quickly using date range, category, or title search filters.
* **Data Persistence:** Your expenses are saved locally in your browser's storage, so your data is available even after you close the tab.
* **Dark Mode:** A comfortable viewing experience for all times of day.
* **Export Data:** Export your expense history to a CSV file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the basic structure of the application.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for a clean and responsive user interface.
* **JavaScript:** Pure, vanilla JavaScript handles all the application logic, data management, and UI updates.
* **Chart.js:** A powerful library for creating the interactive pie and bar charts.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This project is a work in progress. As I continue to learn and build, I plan to add the following features:

* **User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts and log in. This will enable storing expense data securely on a server instead of local storage.
* **Multiple Currencies:** Add support for tracking expenses in different currencies.
* **Basic AI Insights:** Implement small, non-complex AI functionalities, such as:
    * **Spending Anomaly Detection:** Flag unusually high expenses compared to your typical spending patterns.
    * **Personalized Budget Suggestions:** Based on your spending history, suggest potential budgets for the next month.
* **Category Management:** Allow users to add or edit their own custom expense categories.
